# Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas beautifulsoup4
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script:

    ```bash
    cd path_to_script_directory
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python assignement01.py
    ```

    ```bash
    python assignement01.py
    ```

The program will go through all the HTML files in a folder, collect the information, and save it in a TSV file called assignment01.tsv. If some information is missing in the HTML files, it will write 'N/A' in the TSV file. The program will also let you know which files it's currently working on and notify you when it's done.
